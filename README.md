📌 Overview

The Smart Data Analysis Dashboard is a browser-based, offline-capable analytics application designed to help non-technical and business users transform raw data into actionable insights. It enables users to upload datasets, clean and preprocess data, analyze KPIs, visualize trends, and export reports—without writing a single line of code.

Built using Python and Streamlit, the dashboard focuses on usability, speed, and business decision support, making data analysis accessible to students, analysts, and small organizations.
